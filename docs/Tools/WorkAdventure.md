A social space done in a pixel-game-like web space where proximity determines social groups. Allows self selection of conversation groups with an easy/dynamic and intuitive interface (if a bit campy).  VERY good for things like BLUG, LFNW and any group that also has a loose social session as well as the focused ones.

Open source!  Find it on [Github](https://github.com/workadventure/workadventure)  Also allows for [custom maps](https://github.com/workadventure/map-starter-kit) and full API support.

This can easily solve several hybrid meeting issues for community groups.
