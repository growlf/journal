# Journal
My personal journal in technology ...and other things.  I am using [[Obsidian]] to generate and maintain this journal - using [[GitHub-Quartz-Obsidian]] to publish it.

## Recent Project Focuses
- [[Lab Setup/Cloud Init]] - A *needed* thing for Proxmox VMs
- [[The Stack]] - Defining the tech stack I use most
- [[WorkAdventure]] - a cool social communication tool with so much more.
## Who am I?
I am The NetYeti. I answer to "hey, you!", "Yeti", and Garth Johnson - among other things.  I instruct at Bellingham Technical College, consult with clients, and am a avid supporter of all things fun+community+educational. I am also a founding member of [Cascade STEAM](https://www.cascadesteam.org) - a 501.c3 dedicated to many of the things that fill up my heart.
