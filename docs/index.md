# Journal
My personal journal in technology ...and other things.  I am using [[Obsidian]] to generate and maintain this journal - using [[GitHub-Quartz-Obsidian]] to publish it.

## Recent Project Focuses
- [[Lab Setup/Cloud Init]] - A *needed* thing for Proxmox VMs
- [[The Stack]] - Defining the tech stack I use most
- [[WorkAdventure]] - a cool social communication tool with so much more.
